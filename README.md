# Road Safety Mapping Project

## Description

This project visualizes road accident data by categorizing roads into three safety levels:
- Green: Safe roads with minimal accidents.
- Yellow: Roads with a moderate number of accidents.
- Red: High-risk roads with frequent accidents.

The goal is to enhance road safety awareness and provide a tool for safer navigation. In the future, this can be integrated into navigation apps like Waze or Google Maps.
